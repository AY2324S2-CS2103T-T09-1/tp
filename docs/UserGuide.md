--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Welcome!

Thank you for choosing to use TeachStack! Our product aims to help you allocate resources to keep track of weaker students,
and is optimized to be used with the Command Line Interface (CLI).

This is achieved through the use of focus groups, which are groups consisting of students of a weaker skill level.
Focus groups can then be assigned teaching resources such as consultation slots, instructors, teaching venues, and more.
By teaching students of a similar skill level together (i.e. ability grouping), you can tailor your teaching to fit a specific student demographic
instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, saving you time and effort.
Not to mention, ability grouping is [proven to improve the group's progress as a whole.](https://www.ctd.northwestern.edu/blog/what-one-hundred-years-research-says-about-ability-grouping-and-acceleration-students-k-12)
So, are you ready to help students in need?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Target user/audience

TeachStack is tailored for computer science instructors, currently only for those in NUS.

## 3.1 Assumptions
1. We assume that users are passionate educators who wish to see their students succeed. This is important as TeachStack mainly allows instructors to track the performance of weaker students, so the application can only demonstrate its full potential in the hands of instructors who care.
2. We also assume that users are somewhat familiar with computers and have used computer applications in the past, which will help them follow this guide and use TeachStack effectively. Since most instructors will have used similar applications (e.g. Canvas), this is a reasonable assumption to make.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Purpose of User Guide (UG)

The purpose of the User Guide (UG) for TeachStack is to provide users
with a comprehensive understanding of the application's features and
functionalities. Structured to facilitate ease of use and enhance productivity,
the guide offers clear instructions, detailed explanations, and reference
materials such as command summaries and a glossary. By empowering users
with the knowledge to efficiently navigate TeachStack's Command Line Interface (CLI)
and Graphical User Interface (GUI), the UG aims to streamline student management tasks
and ensure optimal utilization of the application's capabilities.

## 7. Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [gp/GROUP]` can be used as `n/John Doe gp/Group 1` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Ellipsis after a parameter indicates that the command can take in multiple values for the parameter.<br>
  e.g. `id/STUDENT_ID…` can be used as `id/A0123434A id/A0232356C` or as `id/A0123434A`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME e/EMAIL`, `e/EMAIL n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do take in parameters (such as `delete` and  `group`) are invalid. This will cause the command to fail.<br>
  e.g. command `delete A0123432A n/John` or `group gp/Group 3 id/A0123212A id/A4938274F n/John` is invalid.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

**Q**: I made changes to the data files manually and I am now facing errors! What should I do?<br>
**A**: We recommend that you only manually edit the files if you are confident that you can update it correctly. In the event that you run into errors after manually editing the files, please delete the `[JAR file location]/data` folder so TeachStack can create new files.

**Q**: Do I have to save my changes manually?<br>
**A**: No, TeachStack will automatically save any changes you have made after a command is entered.

## 10. Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
