## 1. Welcome!

Thank you for choosing to use TeachStack! Our product aims to help you allocate resources to keep track of weaker students,
and is optimized to be used with the Command Line Interface (CLI).

This is achieved through the use of focus groups, which are groups consisting of students of a weaker skill level. 
Focus groups can then be assigned teaching resources such as consultation slots, instructors, teaching venues, and more.

By teaching students of a similar skill level together (i.e. ability grouping), you can tailor your teaching to fit a specific student demographic 
instead of a one-size-fits-all approach, saving you time and effort. 
Not to mention, ability grouping is [proven to improve the group's progress as a whole.](https://www.ctd.northwestern.edu/blog/what-one-hundred-years-research-says-about-ability-grouping-and-acceleration-students-k-12)

So, are you ready to help students in need?


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2. How to use the user guide

This guide explains how you can use TeachStack to manage weaker students. It will walk you through each feature and functionality of the app, ensuring you're equipped to make the most of TeachStack's capabilities.

* To get started with TeachStack. [Quick start](#5-quick-start)
* To understand the GUI. [Understanding our GUI](#61-understanding-our-gui)
* To see details of the commands and features. [Features](#features)
* To quickly navigate to a specific section. [Table of contents](#table-of-contents)
* To see an overview of all commands. [Command summary](#command-summary)
* If you encounter any technical term, please refer to the glossary. [Glossary](#glossary)
* If you encounter any problem, you may find your answer in the FAQ. [FAQ](#faq)

### 2.1 Terminologies / Symbols

Extra information are given in boxes:
* <div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: denotes additional information</div>
* <div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: denotes warning that can cause error</div>

The explanation of each command will be formatted in the following convention:
1. What the command does
2. The format of the command
3. Valid values that the command can take in
4. Example usages
5. _Optional Screenshot_

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## 2. Target user/audience

Therefore, TeachStack is tailored for computer science instructors, not limited to those within NUS.

## 2.1 Assumptions
1. We assume that users are passionate educators who wish to see their students succeed. This is important as TeachStack mainly allows instructors to track the performance of weaker students, so the application can only demonstrate its full potential in the hands of instructors who care.
2. We also assume that users are somewhat familiar with computers and have used computer applications in the past, which will help them follow this guide and use TeachStack effectively. Since most instructors will have used similar applications (e.g. Canvas), this is a reasonable assumption to make.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. Purpose of User Guide (UG)

The purpose of the User Guide (UG) for TeachStack is to provide users
with a comprehensive understanding of the application's features and
functionalities. Structured to facilitate ease of use and enhance productivity,
the guide offers clear instructions, detailed explanations, and reference
materials such as command summaries and a glossary. By empowering users
with the knowledge to efficiently navigate TeachStack's Command Line Interface (CLI)
and Graphical User Interface (GUI), the UG aims to streamline student management tasks
and ensure optimal utilization of the application's capabilities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [gp/GROUP]` can be used as `n/John Doe gp/Group 1` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Ellipsis after a parameter indicates that the command can take in multiple values for the  parameter.<br>
  e.g. `id/STUDENT_ID…` can be used as `id/A0123434A id/A0232356C` or as `id/A0123434A`.

* Parameters must be in specified order.<br>

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do take in parameters (such as `delete` and  `group`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. command `delete A0123432A n/John` or `group gp/Group 3 id/A0123212A id/A4938274F n/John` is invalid.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TeachStack will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous TeachStack home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
